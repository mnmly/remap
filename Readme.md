## remap()

  Re-maps a number from one range to another. In the example above, the number '25' is converted from
  a value in the range 0..100 into a value that ranges from the left edge (0) to the right edge (width) of the screen.
  Numbers outside the range are not clamped to 0 and 1, because out-of-range values are often intentional and useful.
